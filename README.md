# About the Project 
The Dorm Search/Management Project is a website that aims to help students looking for a dorm to make a more informed decision by providing information about the dorm, as well as comments from students who have stayed there. In addition, it is used by multiple user segments thanks to its different panels.
Admin Panel:
The actions we perform in the admin panel are related to creating/updating/deleting the data required by the user who performs a search. In this section, the admin performs the following tasks:
-Dorm/Room operations
-Student registration operations
-Payment/Installment operations
-Location data
-University operations
Student Panel:
In the student panel, registered students can make and edit comments about the dorm and room where they stayed via their reservation.
Guest Panel:
When a guest enters the website, they are presented with three panels. They enter the city, district, and type (Female/Male) of the dorm they are looking for in these panels. Afterwards, the website lists the dorms that meet their criteria along with information about them, comments made about them, and nearby universities.
